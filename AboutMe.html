    <h3>Where it started:</h3>

    <p class="aboutmewords">
        My name is Nakayla and I am 24 years old.
        I got into web development because of my husband who suggested
        I try out a python programming class my second year in collage.
        At first I was against it since it didn't go with my food science degree,
        but ever since that class, I'e loved the whole programming industry since.
        I didn't want to start a lot of my schooling over again so I decided to take this 
        bootcamp in hopes of starting off my career in tech sooner.

        I am forever grateful for my number one supporter in everything, my husband,
        who has never given up on me. No matter how poorly or how great I was doing in school or life.
        He has always been there to support me and my dreams and helping me grow into the healthy
        woman I am today.
    </p>

    <p class="aboutmewords">
        I love being outdoors! Hiking, traveling, my favorite place to <html lang="en">
        those things so far has been the redwood/sequia forest in California and Oregon.
        I love food, so anytime I can cook or go out to eat I'm ALWAYS excited!
