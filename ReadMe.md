Created files for a home page, portfolio, and about me web pages.
On the main page I created a quote, and then put my picture in there.
On the about me page I added 3 picture, and wrote a few paragraphs about myself. I then styled the page in CSS. And made the page link hover transition.
Created a portfolio page that has a picture that is clickable to my github repositories.
Made the nav bar width at 100% (to the margins) because I thought it would look better not being so skinnny.
